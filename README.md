### Summary
The goal of this project is to provide a guided walkthrough for ArgoCD. We will walkthrough the base ArgoCD application and then inspect an additional utility that provides more deployment options (ie, canary and blue/green releases). Many of the documentation here is already provided within these resources:

- [Main ArgoCD Project](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/)
- [ArgoCD Rollouts](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts)
- [ArgoCD Rollouts Demo Application](https://github.com/argoproj/rollouts-demo)

If you are following the datou series - you can get instructions for setting up a local cluster [here](https://github.com/datou-tech/datou-k8).
